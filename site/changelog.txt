1.9
	- Fixed Model::find()
	- Fixed Form::open()

1.8
	- Models now are capable of being used statically to retrieve arrays, which means Collections are redundant now.
	- Models have new static methods:
		- Model::where()
		- Model::where_and()
		- Model::where_or()
		- Model::order_by()
		- Model::limit()
		- Model::paginate()
		- The above methods all now return a Database instance, so you will need to follow it up by ->get() to actually send the query to the db and receive the array
	- New method Model::all() which will retrieve every single record from the table.
	- Model functions hasMany, belongsTo, hasOne and belongsToMany no longer need namespaced model names.
	- eg: return $this->hasMany('App\Model\Post', 'user_id') can now be expressed as $this->hasMany('Post', 'user_id')
	- Needs a longer explanation but when linking models to other models, you no longer need to use function brackets when retrieving results.
	- eg: $user->posts() is now expressed as $user->posts
	- The benefit to this is when you want to order those posts, you can use the function style to add extra things.
	- eg: $user->posts()->order_by('date')->get()

1.7
	- Added method type (GET or POST) to 404 error page
	- script() and style() now require the full path. eg, style('/assets/css/style.css')
	- Added optional second parameter to Upload::to_folder($path, $prefix)
	- $prefix is used to add a prefix before the filename, to help avoid filename collisions
	- $prefix can be either a string, a number, or a callback function
		- If it is a function, it is run once for each file in the upload queue
	- Form::open_upload() is no longer necessary, Form::open() always includes enctype="multipart/form-data"

1.6
	- Added where_or() to Collection
	- Added Form::search()

1.5
